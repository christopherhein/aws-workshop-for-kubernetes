= Clean Up

Once you have finished with the workshop, please don't forget to spin down your
cluster or you will incur additional charges.
(We will also remind you at the end!)

==== Delete Kubernetes cluster resources

In your Cloud9 IDE, check if there are any running kubernetes cluster

[source,shell]
----
kops get cluster
----

Delete kubernetes cluster

[source,shell]
----
kops delete cluster {{ CLUSTER_NAME }} --yes
----

Wait until all resources are deleted by kops

==== Delete Cloud9 Envionment

Go to CloudFormation console, right click template with name *k8s-workshop* and
select *Delete Stack*

This should delete all the resources associated with this workshop

== Appendix: Manual Cloud9 Configuration

This appendix provides instructions for those who don't want to use the
provided CloudFormation template, or who would like to configure Cloud9 
manually.

AWS Cloud9 is only available in 5 regions currently. Please choose the region
closest to you geographically.

Once there, follow these steps:

1. Provide a name for your environment.  Feel free to use something simple,
such as `k8s-workshop`.  Then click "Next Step".

2. Change the "Instance Type" to `t2.small (2 GiB RAM + 1 vCPU)`.

3. Expand the "Network settings (advanced)" section and make sure you are using
the default VPC.  It will have "(default)" next to the name.  If you do not
have a default VPC listed, it is recommended that you create a "Single Public
Subnet" VPC by clicking the "Create new VPC" button and following the wizard it
presents.

4. If everything is correct, click the "Next Step" button.

5. Review the configuration to ensure everything is correct and then click the
"Create environment" button.

This will close the wizard and you will be taken to a screen informing you that
your new AWS Cloud9 environment is being created.  Once this is completed, the
IDE will open to the following screen:

Your environment is now ready to be setup for working with Kubernetes and the
rest of this workshop.

=== Set up Environment

Your AWS Cloud9 environment comes with many useful tools preinstalled, but
there are still a few tweaks to these and additional tools you will need to
support working with Kubernetes.

=== Configure the AWS CLI

Your AWS Cloud9 environment comes with the AWS CLI preinstalled and configured
to automatically use the credentials of the currently logged in user. Make
sure you are logged in as a user with 
link:aws-permissions.adoc[these permissions.]

[NOTE]
*********************
It is not recommended that you change the default AWS CLI config in your AWS
Cloud9 environment. Instead, it is recommended that you provide the logged in
user's account the permissions needed to make any requests needed by your
project.  More information on this can be found by visiting: 
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/credentials.html[Calling AWS Services from an Environment in AWS Cloud9]
*********************

[NOTE]
All the commands below should be run in the Terminal section of your Cloud9 GUI.

=== Verify Docker Version

Docker is preinstalled.  You can verify the version by running the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ docker --version
Docker version 17.06.2-ce, build 3dfb8343b139d6342acfd9975d7f1068b5b1c3d3
----

You should have a similar or newer version.

=== Install Kubectl CLI

Install the `kubectl` CLI:

[source,shell]
----
curl -Lo kubectl https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.9.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl \
     && chmod +x kubectl \
     && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
----

Add kubectl autocompletion to your current shell:

    $ source <(kubectl completion bash)

You can verify that kubectl is installed by executing the following command:

    $ kubectl version --client
    Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"9", GitVersion:"v1.9.2", GitCommit:"6e937839ac04a38cac63e6a7a306c5d035fe7b0a", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-09-28T22:57:57Z", GoVersion:"go1.8.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

=== Install kops

Install kops using the following:

    $ curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kops/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4)/kops-linux-amd64
    $ chmod +x kops-linux-amd64
    $ sudo mv kops-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kops

=== Collect Availability Zones

kops needs to know the availability zones to use when configuring a cluster. We set an environment variable `$AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES` based on the region.

    $ export AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES="$(aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --query 'AvailabilityZones[].ZoneName' --output text | awk -v OFS="," '$1=$1')"

=== Configure an S3 bucket for kops

kops needs a "`state store`" to store configuration information of the cluster. We will use a s3 bucket with versioning enabled. A state store can work with multiple kops clusters.

[NOTE]
The bucket name must be unique otherwise you will encounter an error on deployment. We will use an example bucket name of `kops-state-store-` and add a randomly generated string to the end.

    $ export S3_BUCKET=kops-state-store-$(cat /dev/urandom | LC_ALL=C tr -dc "[:alpha:]" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | head -c 32)
    $ export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://${S3_BUCKET}
    $ aws s3 mb $KOPS_STATE_STORE
    $ aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket $S3_BUCKET --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

=== Clone the repository

The workshop repository has configuration files that are used to create Kubernetes resources.  You need to clone the repo to have access to those files:

    $ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes

At this point, you should have everything you need to complete any of the sections of the this workshop using your Cloud9 Environment.
