= Creating Your Own Workshop

If you'd like to create your own workshop to run you can do this by copying the
`yaml` files in this directory and chosing the modules you want to be included
from the `_modules.yaml` file at the root of this project.

== Sample Workshop

For example if you wanted to create a new workshop that just showed the
beginning environment and cluster creation modules you can do that by making a
file like the following.

[source,shell]
----
---
id: sample
name: Sample Track
workshop_title: Kubernetes the AWSome Way
revision: sample-track
logo: logo.svg
enable_issue_submission: true
repo_url: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes

content:
  url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/aws-workshop-for-kubernetes/master

modules:
  activate:
  - environment_readme
  - create-cluster_readme
----

Then if you would like to run this module locally you can use `docker`.

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -v ${PWD}:/app-data -e CONTENT_URL_PREFIX="file:///app-data" -e WORKSHOPS_URLS="file:///app-data/_workshops/sample.yaml" christopherhein/workshopper:latest
